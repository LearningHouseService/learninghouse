## Introduction

**learningHouse Service** provides machine learning algorithms based on scikit-learn python library as a RESTful API, with the purpose to give smart home fans an easy possibility to teach their homes.

*This project is in a very early state, but you can already give me feedback on your ideas, what things you want to teach your smart homes.*
